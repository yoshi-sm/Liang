/*(Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off
speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to
take off using the following formula:

length = v^2 / 2a

Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the
acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2),
then, displays the minimum runway length.
