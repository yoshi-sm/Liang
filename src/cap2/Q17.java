/*(Science: wind-chill temperature) How cold is it outside? The temperature alone
is not enough to provide the answer. Other factors including wind speed, relative
humidity, and sunshine play important roles in determining coldness outside. In 2001,
the National Weather Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill temperature
to measure the coldness using temperature and wind speed

twc = 35.74 + 0.6215ta - 35.75v^0.16 + 0.4275tav^0.16

 The formula
cannot be used for wind speeds below 2 mph or temperatures below -58째F or
above 41째F.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between -58째F
and 41째F and a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 then displays the wind-chill
temperature. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute v^0.16*/

        double temperature = input.nextDouble(), windSpeed = input.nextDouble();
        double windChill = 35.74 + (0.6215 * temperature) - (35.75 * Math.pow(windSpeed, 0.16))
                + (0.4275 * temperature * Math.pow(windSpeed, 0.16));
        System.out.print("The wind chill index is " + ((int)(windChill *1000) / 1000.0));
